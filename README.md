Workspace
=========


--2013-12-19--
My personal workspace for work I've done, personal coding, and showing what I can do.

So far, this includes the following:

-ProjectEuler
-HackThisSite

I intend to add:

-An IMS (Information Management System) that will manage the projects I've made.
-Other miscellaneous applications
-A pokedex-style contact list application for Windows 8 phones. I may add android support after. If I'm feeling motivated and generous I'll add apple device support too... Maybe.
